# Guess It

Guess-It is a guessing game for fun. Here the computer generates a random number between `0-99` and we need to guess the number, until we reach the real number.

## Usage

```python
import random

real_number = random.randint(0,99)

guess_number = int(input("Enter the guess number between 0-99:\n"))

```
